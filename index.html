        <p>My hobby is reading interesting books. Whenever i got school and come back to my home i like to read adventurous books after completion of my homework. I am 12yrs old and i am in 7th class and i am studying in sunflower vedic school. Reading books will always keep us happy and busy. It makes us discipling, loyal and importantly a succesful person in our life.</p>

        <h1>About</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of many pages (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover. ... The intellectual content in a physical book need not be a composition, nor even be called a book.</p>
